Summary of pip-audit findings (from Docker run):

- Found 35 known vulnerabilities across 5 packages. Highest-priority items:
  - `gunicorn 20.1.0` — CVE-2024-1135, CVE-2024-6827 — recommended upgrade: `>=22.0.0`.
  - `torch 2.0.1` — multiple advisories (PYSEC/CVE). Recommended upgrade path: `>=2.6.0` or later stable releases; test carefully.
  - `transformers 4.30.2` — many advisories. Recommended upgrade: `>=4.36.0` (or more recent stable release) per advisories.
  - `urllib3 2.0.7` — CVE-2024-37891 and others — recommended update to a patched line (e.g., 1.26.19 or 2.2.2/2.5.0 depending on compatibility).
  - `werkzeug 2.2.3` — advisories; recommend upgrading to 3.x where compatible.

Suggested remediation plan
1. Prioritize server-facing and widely-exploitable CVEs (`gunicorn`, `urllib3`, `werkzeug`) — bump and test.
2. For large ML packages (`torch`, `transformers`):
   - Evaluate whether they are required in production. If not, consider moving them to an optional extras group or separate service.
   - If required, upgrade to patched versions and run integration tests in Docker (GPU/CPU variants as needed).
3. Add CI gates: `pip-audit` and Dependabot (already added) — monitor and auto-open PRs.
4. Pin exact versions (or provide `constraints.txt`) and re-run audits before releases.

Action items you can take now
- Review PR #2 (chore/update-deps-audit) which bumps `torch`, `transformers`, `gunicorn` and adds CI workflows.
- Merge after reviewing CI; run smoke tests in Docker to validate runtime.
- If merge not desired, prepare targeted PRs that bump one package at a time to reduce risk.
